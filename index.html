      <p class="sectionContent">Hiring the right software security help can be costly, especially for non-profits. If you are a non-profit or good cause (without funds), spread the word. A group of white hat security experts provide pro-bono work... why? Because we care and want to make a difference.  Also, it doesn't have to be software security related either.  We are here to help in any technical security related challenges you are burdened with. </p>
      <p class="sectionContent">If you are a software security expert and want to give back, reach out.</p>
      <p class="sectionContent">If you have money, then by all means... we can still make software more secure, together. Contact us to find out how.</p>

      <p class="sectionContent">Do you have code and/or an environment? Let us show you where you have soft spots. Do you need to build a software security program and not sure where to start? We know how to do it in a custom and lightweight manner.  Do you need design reviews of your architecture or want to understand your risk surface? We perform semi-informal threat analysis (because formality takes too long). If you have the time for more formal methods, so do we. Want effective static analysis? We can tweak, tune and add rules to find only what you want... then tell you what they all mean.</p>
